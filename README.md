## Setup and Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/propacityproptech.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd propacityproptech
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## Components
### `ListView.jsx`
A reusable component designed to display lists dynamically. Customize it further to suit application needs.

### `App.jsx`
The root component that integrates all child components and manages the overall layout.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **CSS:** Styling the application for responsiveness and aesthetics.

## Customization
To tailor the application:
1. Update styles in `App.css` or `index.css`.
2. Modify or add components in the `src/components` folder.
3. Adjust configurations in `vite.config.js` for custom build setups.

## Deployment
To deploy the application, build the production-ready files:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist/` folder. Serve this folder using any static file hosting service, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
